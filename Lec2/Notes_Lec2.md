## Traditional ML Pipeline
* Design features for nodes/links/graphs 
* Obtain features for all training data
* Train an ML model:   
▪ Random forest  
▪ SVM  
▪ Neural network, etc.  
* Apply the model:  
▪ Given a new node/link/graph, obtain its features and make a prediction   

## !
using effective features over graphs is the key to achieving good model performance
